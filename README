hachat (haskell chat server)
============================

hachat is a robust, highly concurrent implementation of a chat server with a simple protocol (see http://www.itasoftware.com/careers/work-at-ita/hiring-puzzles.html or below for details), implemented in Haskell. it uses a combination of software transactional memory and lightweight threads to achieve high performance.

the easiest way to run it is to compile Main.hs (ghc Main.hs), run the binary, and pass in an optional port. ./Main -p 9000
