hachat (haskell chat server)
============================

hachat is a robust, highly concurrent implementation of a chat server with a simple protocol (see http://www.itasoftware.com/careers/work-at-ita/hiring-puzzles.html for details), implemented in Haskell. it uses a combination of software transactional memory and lightweight threads to achieve high performance.

the software is prone to constant change, as it's only been development for 2 of my evenings at this point.
