hachat (haskell chat server)
============================

hachat is a robust, highly concurrent implementation of a chat server with a simple protocol (see http://www.itasoftware.com/careers/work-at-ita/hiring-puzzles.html for details), implemented in Haskell. it uses a combination of software transactional memory and lightweight threads to achieve high performance.

probably the best way to run it is to load Server.hs into ghci, and run the "server" function with a single int parameter for the port.

the software is prone to constant change, as it's only been development for 2 of my evenings at this point.
